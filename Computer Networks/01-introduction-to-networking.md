# Introduction to Networking

## What Is a Network?
A computer network is a collection of interconnected devices that communicate so they can share data and resources such as files, printers, storage, and processing power. Each device, often called a node, uses standardized protocols to transmit data over physical or wireless links.

## Why Do We Need Networking?
- **Resource sharing:** Printers, file servers, databases, and specialized hardware can be accessed by multiple users.
- **Seamless communication:** Email, instant messaging, VoIP, and video conferencing rely on connectivity.
- **Distributed computing:** Tasks are split across multiple machines for performance and availability.
- **Internet access:** Endpoints reach global services, SaaS products, and APIs through service providers.
- **Centralized management:** Policies, backups, and security controls can be applied consistently across endpoints.

## Real-World Flow Example
```
Laptop → Wi-Fi Router → ISP Edge → Internet Backbone → Data Center → Application Server → response over reverse path
```
This path highlights how several organizations cooperate—your home network, the ISP, transit providers, and the destination cloud—to deliver a single web page.

## Additional Concepts
- **Performance metrics:** Latency, throughput, jitter, and packet loss determine user experience.
- **Scalability:** Networks are designed so switches, routers, and wireless controllers can be added without major redesign.
- **Security considerations:** Segmentation, authentication, and encryption defend against threats as data leaves a trusted LAN.
