# Types of Networks

## LAN (Local Area Network)
- Covers a small geographic area such as a home, office, or campus building.
- Offers high speeds ranging from 100 Mbps to 10+ Gbps using Ethernet or Wi-Fi.
- Typically administered by a single organization with centralized control.

## WAN (Wide Area Network)
- Spans cities, countries, or continents using leased lines, fiber, satellite, or MPLS.
- Lower bandwidth relative to LANs due to distance and provider costs.
- Connects multiple LANs together (e.g., HQ to branch offices or data centers).

## MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
- Bridges the gap between LAN and WAN by covering an entire city or metro region.
- Often implemented by telecom providers as high-capacity backbones for enterprises, campuses, and mobile carriers.

## Additional Network Categories
- **PAN (Personal Area Network):** Short-range Bluetooth, NFC, or USB connections between wearable devices.
- **CAN (Campus Area Network):** Aggregates multiple LANs across a university or business park.
- **SD-WAN:** Overlay WAN that uses policy-based routing over multiple Internet circuits to optimize cost and performance.
