# Networking Devices

## Modem
- Modulates digital data into analog signals and demodulates incoming analog signals.
- Interfaces end-user equipment with ISP infrastructure (DSL, cable, fiber ONT).

## Router
- Routes packets between different IP networks using routing tables and protocols.
- Performs NAT/PAT, firewall filtering, and VPN termination on many edge devices.

## Switch
- Operates at Layer 2, forwarding frames based on MAC addresses.
- Creates separate collision domains per port and supports VLAN segmentation, QoS, and PoE.

## Hub
- Legacy repeater that broadcasts incoming bits to all ports without inspection.
- Creates a single collision domain; largely obsolete but useful for lab sniffing.

## Additional Building Blocks
- **Access points:** Provide Wi-Fi connectivity and bridge wireless devices to the wired LAN.
- **Gateways:** Translate between different protocol families or industrial buses and IP networks.
- **Security appliances:** Firewalls, IDS/IPS, and proxies enforce policies at network boundaries.
