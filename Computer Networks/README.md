This directory now breaks the core networking topics into dedicated markdown notes so each subject can grow independently. Start with the list below and dive into the area you want to review or expand.

## Topic Map
1. [Introduction to Networking](01-introduction-to-networking.md) – Defines networks, their purpose, and performance/security considerations.
2. [Evolution of Networking](02-evolution-of-networking.md) – Tracks the journey from sneaker-net to SDN-driven clouds.
3. [Types of Networks](03-types-of-networks.md) – Compares LAN, WAN, MAN, and modern overlays.
4. [Network Topologies](04-network-topologies.md) – Outlines star, bus, ring, mesh, and hybrid layouts plus design tradeoffs.
5. [Networking Devices](05-networking-devices.md) – Details modems, routers, switches, hubs, and supporting hardware.
6. [OSI Model](06-osi-model.md) – Breaks down all seven layers with responsibilities and real-world examples.
7. [TCP/IP Model](07-tcp-ip-model.md) – Summarizes the pragmatic four-layer stack and OSI mapping.
8. [IP Addressing & Subnetting](08-ip-addressing-and-subnetting.md) – Covers IPv4 classes, private ranges, masks, and NAT types.
9. [DHCP](09-dhcp.md) – Describes the DORA process and operational options.
10. [DNS](10-dns.md) – Explains hierarchy, record types, and lookup flow.
11. [HTTP/HTTPS](11-http-https.md) – Reviews request/response structure, verbs, and TLS upgrades.
12. [Email Protocols](12-email-protocols.md) – Shows SMTP send paths and IMAP/POP3 retrieval with security notes.
13. [Routing](13-routing.md) – Introduces static vs dynamic routing and key protocols (RIP/OSPF/BGP).
14. [Switching](14-switching.md) – Provides switch functions, VLANs, STP, and advanced capabilities.
15. [ARP](15-arp.md) – Details how IP-to-MAC resolution works and security considerations.
16. [Firewalls](16-firewalls.md) – Compares packet filters, stateful, proxy, and NGFW designs.
17. [Load Balancers](17-load-balancers.md) – Highlights L4/L7 types, algorithms, and modern use cases.
18. [Common Interview Diagram](18-common-interview-diagram.md) – Visualizes the OSI walk when loading a web page.
19. [Real-Life End-to-End Workflow](19-real-life-end-to-end-workflow.md) – Provides the "what happens when" narrative from URL entry to rendering.
20. [Networking Troubleshooting Flow](20-network-troubleshooting-flow.md) – Lists the go-to diagnostic steps from physical to application layers.
