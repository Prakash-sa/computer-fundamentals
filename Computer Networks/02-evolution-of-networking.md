# Evolution of Networking

## From Sneaker-Net to Shared Media
- **Sneaker-net:** Early computers exchanged files via floppy disks or tapes that people carried between machines.
- **Local printers:** Small LANs emerged to let multiple employees share expensive printers and file servers.

## Rise of LAN, MAN, and WAN Connectivity
- **LAN (Local Area Network):** Introduced Ethernet hubs/switches for office-scale connectivity.
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):** Telecom carriers built city-wide fiber rings to interconnect campuses.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network):** Leased telephone lines and Frame Relay links connected distant branches.

## Birth of the Internet
- **ARPANET:** Research network that proved packet switching.
- **TCP/IP standardization:** Unified disparate networks, enabling internetworking.
- **Commercialization:** ISPs adopted TCP/IP, DNS, and BGP to form today’s Internet.

## Modern Era
- **Broadband and fiber:** Mass-market DSL, cable, and FTTH bring multi-gigabit speeds home.
- **Wireless everywhere:** Wi-Fi, LTE/5G, and satellite constellations extend reach.
- **Virtualization and SDN:** Software-defined networking, overlays (VXLAN), and cloud fabrics decouple control from hardware.
