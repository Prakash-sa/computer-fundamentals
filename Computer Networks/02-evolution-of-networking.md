# Evolution of Networking

## Early Days: Sneaker-Net
- Users transported floppy disks/tapes between standalone PCs, a slow and error-prone approach nicknamed *sneaker-net*.
- Interview angle: *"What problem did networks originally try to solve?"* — eliminating manual data transfer and sharing expensive peripherals.

## Rise of LANs
- Ethernet and Token Ring enabled multiple hosts to share printers, file servers, and databases within a building.
- Media shifted from coaxial bus segments to twisted-pair cabling and structured wiring.
- Management tooling (SNMP, RMON) and standards (802.3) made operations predictable.

## WAN Expansion
- Leased lines, X.25, Frame Relay, and ATM linked remote offices; MPLS later provided QoS-aware private clouds.
- Interview cue: *"Differentiate LAN vs WAN technologies."* — cite speed, distance, ownership, and protocols.

## MAN and Carrier Backbones
- Metropolitan fiber rings connected campuses, universities, and early ISPs.
- Public utilities offered dark fiber and SONET/SDH rings for redundancy.

## Internet Emergence
- ARPANET pioneered packet switching; the 1983 TCP/IP flag day unified disparate networks.
- DNS, BGP, and the NSFNET backbone catalyzed commercial ISPs and the global Internet.

## Modern Era
- Broadband (DSL, DOCSIS, FTTH) and Wi-Fi made high-speed access ubiquitous.
- Mobile technology evolved from 2G voice to 5G NR with gigabit wireless broadband.
- Cloud computing and content delivery networks shifted workloads closer to users.
- Virtualization/SDN decouple control planes (OpenFlow, VXLAN, EVPN) enabling automated provisioning.

## Future Trends to Mention
- Edge computing for latency-sensitive IoT workloads.
- Intent-based networking using AI/ML for self-healing infrastructure.
- Quantum-safe cryptography and zero trust designs across hybrid environments.
